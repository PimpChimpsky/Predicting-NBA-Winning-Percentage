# Predicting an NBA Team's Winning Percentage

Utilizing NBA season statistics from the past 5 years, this project's goal is to identify which variables best predict the team's winning percentage. This process was done using bayesian regression where all variables were assigned with reasonable priors on their respective regression coefficient. 

The statistics used were:
 - Points
 - Defensive Rebounds
 - Offensive Rebounds
 - Assists
 - Blocks
 - Steals
 - Turnovers
 - Personal Fouls
 - Offensive Rating
 - Defensive Rating
 - Field Goal Percentage
 - Three Point Percentage
 - Free Throw Percentage
 - Pace
